# FYS3150-Project3

This repository contains c++ code constructing a model for a penning trap, used to run multiple simulations testing both the accuracy of the model, and the physics at work within the system. The majority of the code is devided into files of their own, with header and source files sorted in maps `src` (source files) and `include` (header files), which is has to be linked together when testing the code. The code is split into multiple files: 

- ### `particle_class.h`:
cjnaln


- ### `penningtrap_class.h`:

- ### `filltrap.cpp`:

- ### `logging.cpp`:

- ###  `twoqmotion.cpp`:

- ###  `zdirmotion.cpp`:
